# min-rs-config

## This is a dependency for min-rs to parse config file.

## What is does:
* Parses config file 
* Processes all data got from config.json and saves inside itself
* Then the data can be used to send data to max using min-rs crate

## Development

### This project is still under development, so any contributions or help are welcomed.

P.S. Until the bridge is done, there will be no official documentation, because there is no need for it to exist.
